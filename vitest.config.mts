// Workers reuse one module registry across the files they run, which is what keeps the suite fast:
// the import graph is paid once per worker instead of once per file. The cost is that a file can
// reach the next one through anything process-global — a `vi.mock` factory replaces the module for
// every later file in the worker, and rewriting moment's *global* locale leaves the next file on a
// different week grid. A test that does either names itself `*.isolated.test.ts` and runs in its
// own registry instead.
